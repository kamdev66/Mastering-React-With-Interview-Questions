1. What is React?
:- React is a front-end and open-source javascript library which is useful in developing single-page user interfaces. Under the hood,React uses Virtual DOM.
It follows the component-based approach.Components make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
The small and reusable pieces of code are called 'Components'.
React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

2. What is the DOM?
:- DOM stands Document Object Model.The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree structure.
Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.

3. What is Virtual DOM?
:- React keeps a lightweight representation of the Real DOM in the memory , is known as virtual DOM.
when the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM,rather than 
updating all the objects.

4. what are the differences between virtual and real DOM?
:- Comparison                   Real DOM                             Virtual DOM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Speed                  Slow                                       Faster
2. Memory                 Too much memory wasted                     No memory wastage
3. DOM manipulation       very expensive                             very easy
4. updation               Can directly update HTML                   Can't directly update HTML 
5. Creation               creates a new DOM if element updates       updates the JSX if element updates

5. When to use class component over a function component?
:- It is always recommended to use functional component ,unless you need a react functionality whose
function component equivalent is not present yet,like Error Boundaries.

6. How to pass data from one component to another component?
:- Parent to child:- with the help of props, we can send data from a parent to child component.
